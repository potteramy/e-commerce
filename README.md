# E-Commerce
## About
For this project, I was given starter code to build the backend API for an e-commerce site. Technologies used are NodeJS, MySQL2, dotenv, and Sequelize. I set up and seeded the MySQL database, updated models, created relationships, and finished the API routes to allow create, read, update, and delete operations to be performed.
